# IPTV Playlists
Collections of fully tested and available IPTV playlists for the Indonesian region. All links have been tested using [IPTV Tools](http://www.iptvtools.net/?svc=check) and individually tested by myself using Kodi.

The source used in this playlist is based on various repositories and websites like:
- [iptv-org repository on Github](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv)
- [Free-TV repository on Github](https://github.com/Free-TV/IPTV)
- [IPTV Cat](https://iptvcat.com/indonesia__8)

All links only work on KODI because of `#KODIPROP` and `inputstream` properties inside the m3u files.
