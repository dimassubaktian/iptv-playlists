# IPTV Playlists
Collections of fully tested and available IPTV streams for the Indonesian region, with updated channel icons made by myself based on official channel logos from various sources. All links have been tested using [IPTV Tools](http://www.iptvtools.net/?svc=check) and individually tested by myself.

The source used in this playlist is based on various repositories and websites like:
- [iptv-org repository on Github](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv)
- [Free-TV repository on Github](https://github.com/Free-TV/IPTV)
- [IPTV Cat](https://iptvcat.com/indonesia__8)
- Free live streams from official websites such as [Trans TV Live](https://www.transtv.co.id/live), [Klik TVRI](https://klik.tvri.go.id/), [RodjaTV Live](https://rodja.tv/), [RRI NET](https://rri.co.id/stream/video), [NusantaraTV Live](https://nusantaratv.com/live), [SEAToday Live](https://seatoday.com/tv), [DENS.TV](www.dens.tv), and [many more](https://github.com/OngisMbois/IPTV-PREMIUM).

All links work on [KODI](https://kodi.tv/download/), [OTT Navigator](https://ottnav.github.io/faq.html#ott-navigator-app-availability), and any IPTV player that supports m3u files.
